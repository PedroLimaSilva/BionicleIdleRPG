# Playwright CI Information

## Viewing Test Results in CI

When Playwright tests run in GitHub Actions, the results are uploaded as artifacts.

### How to Access Test Reports

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click on the workflow run you want to inspect
3. Scroll down to **Artifacts** section
4. Download one of these artifacts:
   - `playwright-report` - HTML report with screenshots and diffs
   - `playwright-results` - Raw test results and traces

### Reviewing Visual Changes

1. Download the `playwright-report` artifact
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Open `index.html` in a browser
4. Review any failed tests and their visual diffs

### Updating Snapshots in CI

If visual changes are intentional and you need to update snapshots:

1. Run locally: `yarn test:e2e:update-snapshots`
2. Review the changes carefully
3. Commit the updated snapshots
4. Push to your branch

The CI will use the new snapshots on the next run.

## Snapshot Storage

Snapshots are stored in the repository at:

```
e2e/
  ├── homepage.spec.ts-snapshots/
  ├── recruitment.spec.ts-snapshots/
  ├── character-inventory.spec.ts-snapshots/
  └── ... (other test snapshots)
```

Each snapshot directory contains images for different browsers/viewports:

- `Desktop-Chrome/`
- `Mobile-Safari-Portrait/`
- `Mobile-Safari-Landscape/`

## CI Performance

- Tests run in parallel where possible
- Typical run time: 2-5 minutes
- Retries: 2 attempts on failure (CI only)
- Artifacts retained for 30 days
